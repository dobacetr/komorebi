## About the Fork

This is a personal fork that I have made to use myself:

* Updated dependencies for Ubuntu 24.04.
* Added video-preview to wallpaper-creator
* Changed program directory from /System/... to ~/komorebi/System/...
* Added _meson_ build files for linting using vala-language-server.

## How do I create my own wallpaper?

Komorebi provides a simple tool to create your own wallpapers! Simply, open your apps and search for 'Wallpaper Creator'

![s1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dobacetr/komorebi/main/screenshots/wallpaper_creator.jpg)

You can use either an image, a video, or a web page as a wallpaper and you have many different options to customize your very own wallpaper!

## Uninstall

### If you installed a packaged version of Komorebi

1. Open Terminal
2. `sudo apt remove komorebi`

### If you installed Komorebi from the source

You can remove the <code>~/Komorebi</code> folder.

## Questions? Issues?

### Komorebi is slow. What can I do about it?

Komorebi includes support for video wallpapers that might slow your computer down. You can disable support for video wallpapers in 'Desktop Preferences' â†’ uncheck 'Enable Video Wallpapers'.

_note: you need to quit and re-open Komorebi after changing this option_


### After uninstalling, my desktop isn't working right (blank or no icons)

The latest Komorebi should already have a fix for this issue. If you've already uninstalled Komorebi and would like to fix the issue, simply run this (in the Terminal):
```
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dobacetr/komorebi/main/data/Other/postrm | \
bash -s
```
If your issue has not already been reported, please report it *[`here`](https://github.com/dobacetr/komorebi/issues/new)* and I'll try my best to fix them.

### Thanks To:
